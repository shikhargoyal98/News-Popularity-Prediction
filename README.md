**Online Popularity Prediction**

**Overview:**

The Online Popularity Prediction project aims to predict the future popularity of online content (e.g., articles, social media posts, products, videos) using various data sources, including user engagement metrics, content features, and historical trends. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast how well content will perform in the future, based on past and present data.
This repository contains the code, data processing steps, and models for predicting the popularity of online content. It is intended for researchers, data scientists, and developers interested in building predictive models for online engagement.

**Features:**

Content Analysis: Predict the popularity of articles, social media posts, or videos based on textual and metadata features.
Engagement Metrics: Use data such as likes, shares, comments, views, and time spent on content to make predictions.
Machine Learning Models: Multiple predictive models, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, for popularity forecasting.
Time Series Analysis: Predict long-term trends in content popularity by analyzing temporal patterns.
Visualization: Graphical tools to visualize trends, predictions, and performance metrics.
